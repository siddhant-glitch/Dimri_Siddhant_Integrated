                <p>We are all caught up in a giant net, with people we want to become and people they want to become. It's a never ending chain of people trying to be someone the are not and the people they are trying to be, trying to be someone else too. We all are trying to impress someone, arranging our thoughts in ways that aligns with the one we follow.
Why is it so important—what others have done?
All we have to question is why things aren't the way they are "supposed" to be. It's a matter of time after you realise that everyone is a reflection of everyone else. It's like two mirrors, parallel to each other, reflecting each other- infinite reflections. In a maze of what is real and what isn't, what should be and what shouldn't, we forget the first reflection, or perhaps the one being reflected, the real.</p>
